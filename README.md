 # Host a website using Docker and Nginx <br/>
 - Login to your AWS account and download your passkey and launch the EC2 instance.  
- Launch PuTTY and add the IP address from instance and add key pair file and open the PuTTY terminal.
- Login to the OS by writing "ubuntu"
- After that I have to install docker in my OS .<br/>
- Now install Docker using following command:
```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/ShubhamTatvamasi/docker-install/raw/master/docker-install.sh | bash
```
- Type following command to avoid using ``sudo`` always (right that's irritating)
```bash
newgrp docker
```
- Then type (This will provides a list of the Docker containers on your machine)
```bash
docker ps
```
- You can check your docker version by typing:
```bash
docker --version
```
- Now, to use ``Nginx`` in our container use:
```bash
docker pull nginx
```
- And:
```bash
docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 nginx
```
- Now you can type your instance's IP and see Nginx default web page.
Use following command to stop the container from running:
```bash
ctrl + c
```
- Use following command to reveals that the Docker container has been exited:
```bash
docker ps -a
```
- Use following command to see container's ID
```bash
docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 -d nginx
```
- Use following command to see new information about container:
```bash
docker ps
```
- Use following command to stop the container:
```bash
docker stop docker-nginx
```
- Then remove default Nginx page and create new custom html file using following commands:
```bash
docker rm docker-nginx
```
```bash
mkdir -p ~/docker-nginx/html
```
Now navigate to file created:
```bash
cd ~/docker-nginx/html
```
- Now create a ``index.html`` and write a html code on ``vim`` code editor:
```bash
vi index.html
```
- Now write your code and save the file.
Then connect the file to instance:
```bash
docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 -d -v ~/docker-nginx/html:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```
## it will run other wise you make some correction in program. so, you need to recheck the program.
